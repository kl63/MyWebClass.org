# About MyWebClass.org 

## Our Mission

As innovators, we are committed to transforming education for the AI-driven world by adopting a new paradigm that empowers our students with the knowledge and skills they need to flourish in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. The existing factory school model, a legacy of the Industrial Revolution, is no longer adequate. Therefore, our focus is on nurturing creativity, adaptability, and collaboration - essential skills for success in the AI-driven world.

MyWebClass.org is at the forefront of this transformation, incorporating Agile and Lean principles into the classroom. Our mission includes conducting research on effective strategies, developing resources and tools, offering professional development opportunities, and collaborating with schools and educators to foster a culture of continuous improvement, collaboration, and adaptability. By incorporating Agile and Lean principles in the classroom, we aim to support students' mental health by cultivating resilience, adaptability, and a sense of accomplishment. Our ultimate goal is to create a network of professionals dedicated to revolutionizing education and preparing students for success in the AI-driven world.

Our commitment to this mission reflects the historical and cultural context that has shaped our current educational system. As societal expectations change and the skills required for success evolve, we believe embracing change in education and transcending the factory school model is essential. Organizations like MyWebClass.org play a crucial role in driving this paradigm shift by incorporating Agile and Lean principles into the classroom. By working together, we can create an environment where students are better prepared for the future.
